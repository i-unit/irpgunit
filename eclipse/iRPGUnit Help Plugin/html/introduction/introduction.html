<h1>Introduction</h1>

The iRPGUnit plug-in connects the <i>IBM Rational Developer for i</i> with the RPGUnit library, that 
was started by Lacton back in September 2006. It adds a context menu item to the Remote Systems 
Explorer to let you run your RPGUnit test suites directly from the explorer.
<p>
The plug-in bases on source code originally developed by Mihael Schmidt 
at <a href="http://rpgnextgen.com/">RPG Next Gen<a>. It fixes a few bugs 
and adds some improvements, such as the report viewer and call stack information.
<p>
The RPGUnit library is an enhanced version of the RPGUnit library developed by Laction and 
continued by Cyril Clemenceau at <a href="http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net/">RPGUnit at SourceForge</a>. 
Unfortunately it seems as if the project is no longer alive. Nevertheless the original
Internet pages at SourceForge are still a good source of information.

                        been moved from source file RPGUNIT1 to source file QINCLUDE. Currently iRPGUnit
                        is shipped with a proxy member in file RPGUNIT1 to ensure backward compatibility
                        at compile time. This proxy member will be removed after 31.12.2019 with a later
                        version of iRPGUnit.<p>
