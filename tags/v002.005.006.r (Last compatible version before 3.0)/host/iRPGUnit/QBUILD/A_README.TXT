  i5 part of the RPGUnit plug-in for
  IBM Rational Developer for Power Systems
--------------------------------------------

The RPGUnit plug-in connects the IBM Rational Developer for Power Systems
with the RPGUnit, that was started by Lacton back in September 2006. It
adds a context menu item to the Remote Systems Explorer to let you run
your RPGUnit test suites directly from the explorer.

The plug-in bases on the code of the RPG Next Gen Editor that is
developed and provided by Mihael Schmidt at http://rpgnextgen.com/.

The i5 part of the plug-in uses an enhanced version of the RPGUnit plug-in
that was originally developed by Laction and continued by Cyril Clemenceau
at http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net/. Unfortunately it seems as if the project
is no longer alive. Nevertheless the original Internet pages at SourceForge
are still a good source of information.

The Eclipse update site of the plug-in is at:
   https://irpgunit.sourceforge.io/eclipse/rdi8.0/

Let me know your experiences!

The following errors are produced by units tests of version 1.10 and lower:

ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure
   Expected '9800', but was '16800'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doAssert().

ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: The new "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvtLong_t) had to be mapped to the
           old "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvt_t) structure, which properly sets
           the length bytes of "assertFailEvt_v1.msg" to x'0000'. These bytes
           had been set to x'4040' before. Procedure ASSERT.clrAssertFailEvt()
           now uses 'clear' instead of '*BLANKS' to initialize the assert fail
           event structure.

                   msgInfo = getMonitoredMsg(*ON); // remove message
                 endmon;                           // from job log

                 aEqual( 'MCH1211': msgInfo.Id );


Version 1.3 - 15.08.2013
------------------------
 * Fixed errors in 'upload_src.bat'.
 * Fixed selftest unit test cases. The unit test cases had to be
   fixed because of internal changes that were required for the
   plug-in:

      Changed:     'assertFailEvt_t'.

      Changed:     Now, handleSuccess() is called regardless of the
                   value of 'detail'. Affects: 'logIdx'.
      Changed:     Formatting of call stack entry.
      Bugfix:      Close spooled file after error (RUACPTST).
      Changed:     Prototypes of getCrtRpgModCmd() and getCrtSrvPgmCmd().
      Changed:     'TestResult_t'.

      New demonstration unit tests:

      RUPLUGINT1   RUPLUGINT3
      RUPLUGINT2   RUPLUGINT4

   VARYING field to program RUPGMRMT.
 * Now the plug-in correctly enables/disables actions 'Rerun All
   Unit Tests' and 'Rerun Selected Unit Tests' when the view
   is opened.
 * Now the plug-in checks for job description 'RPGUNIT' when
   parameter 'LIBL' is set to '*JOBD'.
 * Ported plug-in back to WDSC 7.0.
 * Refactored plug-in as suggested in 'templates' by the original
   author and replaced 'ExcpMsgInfo_t' with 'Msg_t'.
