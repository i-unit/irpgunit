  i5 part of the RPGUnit plug-in for
  IBM Rational Developer for Power Systems
--------------------------------------------

The RPGUnit plug-in connects the IBM Rational Developer for Power Systems
with the RPGUnit, that was started by Lacton back in September 2006. It
adds a context menu item to the Remote Systems Explorer to let you run
your RPGUnit test suites directly from the explorer.

The plug-in bases on the code of the RPG Next Gen Editor that is
developed and provided by Mihael Schmidt at http://rpgnextgen.com/.

The i5 part of the plug-in uses an enhanced version of the RPGUnit plug-in
that was originally developed by Laction and continued by Cyril Clemenceau
at http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net/. Unfortunately it seems as if the project
is no longer alive. Nevertheless the original Internet pages at SourceForge
are still a good source of information.

The Eclipse update site of the plug-in is at:
   https://irpgunit.sourceforge.io/eclipse/rdi8.0/

Let me know your experiences!

   CRTBNDCL   PGM(RPGUNIT/A_INSTALL) SRCFILE(RPGUNIT1)

   CALL       PGM(RPGUNIT/A_INSTALL) PARM('RPGUNIT')

c) Optionally delete the installation program:
   DLTPGM     PGM(RPGUNIT/A_INSTALL)

              History
--------------------------------------


Version 2.2.2 - 09.05.2018
--------------------------
Changed: Improved error reporting when validating a service program or
         procedure.
Changed: Changed A_INSTALL to pass the TGTRLS parameter to all called
         MK* programs.


Version 2.2.1 - 08.02.2018
--------------------------
Changed: Changed RPGUnit view to display the number of assertions.
Changed: Fixed problem, that a test procedure had to start with 'test'
         in lower case. Now the case is ignored.
Fixed:   Now errors in setup/teadown procedures properly show up in RDi.
Changed: Added number of executed assertions to RPGUnit view.


Version 2.0.0 - 10.10.2017
--------------------------
Changed: Changed length of message text from 256 to 1024 bytes.
Added:   Added unit test RUPLUGINT5.
Added:   Added procedure getAssertFailEvtLong() to retrieve the long
         message text.
Added:   Added new type definition AssertFailEvtLong_t for procedure
         getAssertFailEvtLong().
Fixed:   Fixed hard coded reference to library RPGUNIT in unit test RUCRTTSTT.
Fixed:   Fixed missing 'Export' keyword of procedure 'tearDown' of unit test 'CRTTSTT'.
Changed: Renamed RUN to CMDRUNSRV.
Changed: Renamed RUCRTTST to CRTTST.
Changed: Renamed RUPGMRMT to PGMRMT.
Changed: Renamed RURUNRMT to RMTRUNSRV.
Changed: Renamed RUSRCMBR to SRCMBR.
Changed: Renamed RUTAGTST to TAGTST.
Changed: Renamed MKRUNRMT to MKRMTRUN.
Changed: Renamed RUCRTTSTT to CRTTSTT.

The following errors are produced by units tests of version 1.10 and lower:

ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure
   Expected 'assert', but was 'DOASSERT'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doAssert().

ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: The new "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvtLong_t) had to be mapped to the
           old "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvt_t) structure, which properly sets
           the length bytes of "assertFailEvt_v1.msg" to x'0000'. These bytes
           had been set to x'4040' before. Procedure ASSERT.clrAssertFailEvt()
           now uses 'clear' instead of '*BLANKS' to initialize the assert fail
           event structure.

ASSERTT.testBidIntegerEquality
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

ASSERTT.testGoodByeIsNotHello
   Expected 'assert', but was 'DOASSERT'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

ASSERTT.testHelloEqualsHello
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

ASSERTT.testTwoAndTwoEqualsFour
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

ASSERTT.testTwoAndTwoIsNotEqualToFive
   Expected 'assert', but was 'doAssert'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

RUNT.test_runTestProc_errorInSetup
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUNT.test_runTestProc_errorInTearDown
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUNT.test_runTestProc_errorInTest
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUNT.test_runTestProc_failureInTest
   Expected 'TEST_FAIL', but was 'fail'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doFail().

RUNT.test_runTestProc_tearDownAfterErrorInSetup
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUACPTST.TESTBIGINTEGER
   Expected 'assert', but was 'DOASSE'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

RUACPTST.TESTCHOOSETEST
   Expected 'TEST2 (TESTPGM05', but was 'fail (RUTESTCASE'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doFail().

RUACPTST.TESTFAILURES
   Expected 'assert', but was 'DOASSE'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

RUACPTST.TESTSTACKTRACE
   Expected 'assert', but was 'DOASSE'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

         parameter to RUPGMRMT to execute all test cases.


Version 1.7.2 - 19.02.2014
--------------------------

                       a = 10;
                       b = 0;     // Attempt made to divide by zero for
                       c = a / b; // fixed point operation. (MCH1211)
                       fail( 'Division by zero did not raise an error.' );
                     on-error;

         Unit Tests' and 'Rerun Selected Unit Tests' when the view
         is opened.
New:     Now the plug-in checks for job description 'RPGUNIT' when
         parameter 'LIBL' is set to '*JOBD'.
New:     Ported plug-in back to WDSC 7.0.
Changed: Refactored plug-in as suggested in 'templates' by the original
         author and replaced 'ExcpMsgInfo_t' with 'Msg_t'.
